# Online Auction Market Based on Blockchain

An online auction platform based on blockchain would be great improvement over current auction systems. With the blockchain structure auction data and bids will be impossible to falsify. The platform will be transparent, reliable and scalable. With the help of this market anyone can place any item to auction and bidder can bid and buy items without any fraud.

## Methodology / Resources

We are planning to use IBM Bluemixâ€™s open source platform hyperledger composer for creating blockchain.

For user interface we will be creating ReactJS application with the REST api support which will be communicating with the blockchain backend to create participant, assets and transaction. We will be deploying our blockchain network on Docker.

We will be using following resources:
* https://composer-playground.mybluemix.net/
* https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/
